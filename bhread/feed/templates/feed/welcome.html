<p> Basically, we take blog posts and allow other blogs to reply to it. </p>
<p class="my-4 ">How?</p>
<p>Simply publish a post containing "replying to " followed by a link. Like this:</p>

<pre class="my-4 bg-orange-50 p-4 rounded dark:bg-sky-950 dark:text-white text-sm">
replying to <a href="https://bhread.com/welcome">bhread.com/welcome</a>

Hello World!
</pre>

<p>
This tells bhread to create a <i>threaded</i> post containing your post as a reply.
</p>

<p class="mt-6">Here's an example thread:</p>
<div id="demo" class="max-w-full">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elpachongco/bhread/main/img/README-bhread-convo-example-2.png" alt="Image demonstration of replies"
  class="w-full h-auto">
</div>


<p>Replies are great but it's only one example of Bhread's capabilities. Bhread allows any blogger to:</p>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside">
    <li>Automatically post new content (using <a href="https://www.youneedfeeds.com/">feeds</a>),</li>
  <li>reply to other bloggers,</li>
  <li>repost their content,</li>
  <li>and create groups.</li>
  </ul>

<p class="mt-4">Most importantly, you don't need an account to participate!</p>
<p><small>You can create an account to customize things but a blog is all you need to participate.</small></p>

<a rel="next" href="https://bhread.com" class="ml-auto my-8 underline underline-offset-4 text-lg">Shut up and take <s>my money</s> me to Bhread</a>
